## Description

[josband.github.io](https://josband.github.io/) is my own personal website with a frontend UI being served through github pages and a backend hosted on Cyclic's free tier. I then use Cloudflare's free plan to enable SSL/TSL encrypted connections to be established between the user and server(TODO).

### Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Express
- React
- NodeJS
